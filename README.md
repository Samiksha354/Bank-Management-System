# 🏦 Bank Management System (Java & MySQL)

A Java-based Bank Management System that simulates real-world ATM operations using Java Swing for the user interface and MySQL for secure data storage. The application supports essential banking features such as authentication, transactions, and account management with real-time database integration.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in Object-Oriented Programming, JDBC, GUI development, and database handling, making it ideal for academic submissions and software engineering portfolios.

The Bank Management System is designed to replicate the basic working of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and core banking operations. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing, allowing users to perform banking transactions in an interactive and intuitive manner.

The system begins with a secure login module, where users authenticate themselves using a card number and PIN. Once authenticated, users are redirected to the main transaction screen, from where they can choose various banking services such as deposit, cash withdrawal, fast cash, balance enquiry, mini statement, and PIN change.

All transactions are stored and managed using a MySQL database, ensuring persistent data storage and real-time updates. The balance is dynamically calculated based on transaction history, maintaining accuracy and consistency. The mini statement feature displays recent transactions along with masked card details for added security.

The project also includes a multi-step account registration process, where new users can sign up by providing personal and additional details. A PIN change module allows users to securely update their PIN across all related database tables.

This project demonstrates strong concepts of object-oriented programming, event-driven programming, JDBC database connectivity, and GUI development in Java. It serves as an excellent learning project for understanding real-world application flow and is suitable for academic submissions, resumes, and portfolio showcases
